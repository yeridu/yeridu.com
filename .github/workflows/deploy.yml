# GITHUB ACTIONS WORKFLOW - AUTOMATIC DEPLOYMENT
# =============================================================================
# This file tells GitHub to automatically build and deploy your website
# every time you push changes to the main branch.
#
# HOW IT WORKS:
# 1. You push code to GitHub
# 2. GitHub sees this file and runs the steps below
# 3. Your website is built and deployed to GitHub Pages
# 4. Your live site updates automatically!
#
# You don't need to edit this file unless you're customizing the build process.
# =============================================================================
