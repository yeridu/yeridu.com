## Research Agenda Summary

I study the prevention of dating violence, substance use, and mental illness among adolescents, using mixed methods across U.S., Mexico, and Belize. My dissertation and projects examine population-level risk and protective factors, bystander interventions (e.g., Green Dot), and the integration of mental health promotion with violence and substance use prevention. My training spans anthropology, demography, public policy, and public health.
Selected Key Achievements

•	12+ peer‑reviewed publications (BMC Public Health, IJERPH, BMJ Open, AJPH, Lancet Public Health).
•	4 key works in progress: Dating violence/Substance use systematic review; alcohol‑related victim blaming (Green Dot); Non-medical prescription opioid use–suicidality (YRBS 2023); and physical dating violence attitudes (Belize MICS).
•	>$30,000 in research/travel awards (ICPSR, SICSS, Tinker, GHI Scholars, GPSC).
•	International fieldwork: U.S., Mexico, Belize, South Africa.
•	TA and guest lectures in health promotion/public policy; mixed‑methods instruction.

## Teaching

### Philosophy Snapshot

I center inclusive, active learning with real‑world data/problems. Mixed methods and cross‑cultural cases equip students to connect theory, measurement, and intervention design in public health. I focus on teaching students how to incorporate AI into their learning journey (e.g., NotebookLM).
