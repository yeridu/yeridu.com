# Abstract
abstract: |
  **Background:** Mexican law permits syringe purchase and possession without prescription. Nonetheless, people who inject drugs (PWID) frequently report arrest for syringe possession. Extrajudicial arrests not only violate human rights, but also significantly increase the risk of blood-borne infection transmission and other health harms among PWID and police personnel. To better understand how police practices contribute to the PWID risk environment, prior research has primarily examined drug user perspectives and experiences. This study focuses on municipal police officers (MPOs) in Tijuana, Mexico to identify factors associated with self-reported arrests for syringe possession.

  **Methods:** Participants were active police officers aged ≥18 years, who completed a self-administered questionnaire on knowledge, attitudes and behaviors related to occupational safety, drug laws, and harm reduction strategies.

  **Results:** The study identified key factors associated with extrajudicial arrests for syringe possession among police officers, highlighting the disconnect between law and practice.

  **Conclusions:** Findings underscore the need for police education programs that align law enforcement practices with public health priorities and legal frameworks.

## Plain Language Summary

In Mexico, it's legal to buy and carry syringes without a prescription. However, people who inject drugs (PWID) often report being arrested for having syringes on them. These illegal arrests violate human rights and increase the risk of HIV and other infections—both for drug users who may share needles out of fear, and for police officers who may get accidentally stuck.

Most research has asked drug users about their experiences with police. This study took a different approach: we surveyed over 1,000 police officers in Tijuana, Mexico to understand what factors lead some officers to make these illegal arrests.

**Why it matters:** When police arrest people for something that isn't actually illegal, it creates a dangerous cycle. Drug users avoid carrying clean syringes, leading to needle sharing and disease transmission. Understanding why some officers make these arrests can help design better training programs that protect both public health and human rights.
