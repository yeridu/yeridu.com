# Abstract
abstract: |
  **Background:** Police crackdowns on people who use drugs remain common despite evidence of their ineffectiveness and potential harms. This study examines police officers' perspectives on a major crackdown operation in Tijuana, Mexico.

  **Methods:** We conducted qualitative interviews with municipal police officers to understand their experiences implementing "Pick Up Anything That Moves"—an aggressive sweep targeting homeless individuals and people who use drugs.

  **Results:** Officers described tensions between public health approaches and enforcement mandates. Many expressed discomfort with blanket operations targeting vulnerable populations, revealing opportunities for harm reduction integration.

  **Conclusions:** Police perspectives provide crucial insights for designing more effective, humane approaches to drug policy implementation.

# Summary (short description for cards)

## Plain Language Summary

In Tijuana, Mexico, police sometimes conduct large "sweep" operations where they round up homeless people and those who use drugs. We interviewed police officers to understand what these operations are really like from their perspective.

**What we found:** Many officers felt uncomfortable with these aggressive tactics. They could see that simply arresting people didn't solve drug problems—it often made things worse. Some officers were open to learning about harm reduction approaches that could actually help people.

**Why it matters:** If we want to improve how cities respond to drug use, we need to understand how police officers think about their role. This research shows there's potential for training programs that help police become partners in public health rather than just enforcers.
