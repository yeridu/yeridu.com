# Abstract
abstract: |
  **Background:** Using baseline data from three partnering federally qualified health centers, we examined factors associated with depressive symptoms among Mexican-origin adults at risk of chronic disease living in three counties in Southern Arizona (i.e., Pima, Yuma, and Santa Cruz).

  **Methods:** Multivariable linear regression models identified correlates of depressive symptoms for this population controlling for sociodemographic characteristics.

  **Results:** Among 206 participants, 85.9% were female and 49% were between 45 and 64 years of age. The proportion of depressive symptoms was 26.8%. Low levels of physical pain and high levels of hope and social support were also reported. Physical pain was positively and significantly related to depressive symptoms (β = 0.22; 95% CI = 0.13, 0.30). Conversely, hope was negatively and significantly associated with depressive symptoms (β = −0.53; 95% CI = −0.78, −0.29).

  **Conclusions:** A better understanding of factors related to depressive symptoms among Mexican-origin adults is necessary to fulfill their mental health needs, as well as to achieve health equity and to eliminate health disparities in the US–Mexico border region.

## Plain Language Summary

This study looked at what factors are linked to feeling depressed among Mexican-origin adults living near the Arizona-Mexico border. We surveyed 206 adults who visited community health centers in three Arizona counties.

We found that about 1 in 4 participants (26.8%) reported depressive symptoms. People who experienced more physical pain were more likely to feel depressed. On the other hand, people who felt more hopeful about the future were less likely to feel depressed.

**Why it matters:** Mexican-origin adults face unique challenges in border communities, including limited access to mental health services. Understanding what protects against or increases risk for depression helps community health workers and clinics better support this population's mental health needs.
