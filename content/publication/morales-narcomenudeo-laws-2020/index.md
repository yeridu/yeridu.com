# Abstract
abstract: |
  **Background and Aims:** Drug policy reforms typically seek to improve health among people who use drugs (PWUD), but flawed implementation impedes potential benefits. Mexico's 2009 drug policy reform emphasized public health-oriented measures to address addiction. Implementation has been deficient, however. We explored the role of municipal police officers' (MPOs) enforcement decision-making and local systems as barriers to reform operationalization.

  **Methods:** Between February-June 2016, 20 semi-structured interviews were conducted with MPOs in Tijuana. Interviews were transcribed, translated and coded using a consensus-based approach. Emergent themes, trends and frameworks were analyzed through a hermeneutic grounded theory protocol.

  **Results:** In conceptualizing their orientation towards municipal (not state) law, MPOs reported prioritizing enforcement of nebulous anti-vice ordinances to control PWUD activity. Local laws were seen as conflicting with drug policy reforms. Incentives within the police organization were aligned with ordinance enforcement, generating pressure through quotas and reinforced by judges. Driven by discretion, fuzzy understanding of procedures, and incentives to sanitize space, detention of PWUD for minor infractions was systematic.

  **Conclusions:** Failure to harmonize policies and priorities at different levels of government undermine effective operationalization of health-oriented drug policy. Implementation must address local priorities and administrative pressures shaping MPO decision-making and enforcement practice.

## Plain Language Summary

In 2009, Mexico passed a major drug policy reform called "Narcomenudeo" that was supposed to treat drug addiction as a health issue rather than a crime. Small amounts of drugs for personal use were partially decriminalized, and people caught with drugs were supposed to be offered treatment instead of jail time.

But did this reform actually change anything on the streets of Tijuana? We interviewed 20 municipal police officers to find out why the reform wasn't working.

**What we found:** Police officers told us they don't really follow federal drug laws—they follow local city ordinances. These local rules let them arrest people for vague things like "antisocial behavior" or "activities leading to vice." Officers also face pressure from supervisors to meet arrest quotas, and the easiest people to arrest are homeless drug users. So instead of getting help, people who use drugs keep getting arrested for minor infractions—just under different rules.

**Why it matters:** This study shows that passing a good law isn't enough. If local rules, police incentives, and court systems aren't aligned with the reform, nothing changes on the ground. People who use drugs in Tijuana still face criminalization despite federal law saying they should get health services instead.
