# Abstract
abstract: |
  **Background:** Diabetes disproportionately affects Mexican-origin populations in border regions. Understanding modifiable risk factors in community settings is essential for developing culturally appropriate interventions.

  **Methods:** Cross-sectional analysis of a community sample examining social, behavioral, and environmental factors associated with diabetes prevalence among Mexican-origin adults in Southern Arizona.

  **Results:** We identified multiple modifiable factors associated with diabetes, including dietary patterns, physical activity, and access to healthcare. Social determinants played a significant role in diabetes risk.

  **Conclusions:** Community-based interventions addressing both individual behaviors and social-structural factors may be most effective for diabetes prevention in this population.

## Plain Language Summary

Diabetes is a major health problem for Mexican-origin communities along the US-Mexico border. We studied what factors put people at higher risk for diabetes in this community.

**What we found:** Diet, exercise, and access to doctors all matter—but so do "social determinants" like income, education, and neighborhood conditions. People facing multiple challenges were at higher risk.

**Why it matters:** To effectively prevent diabetes in border communities, programs need to address not just individual choices but also the community conditions that make healthy living difficult.
