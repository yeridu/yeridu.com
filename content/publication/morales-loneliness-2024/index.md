# Abstract
abstract: |
  **Background:** Loneliness is a significant public health concern associated with numerous adverse health outcomes. Mexican-origin adults living in border regions face unique social and economic challenges that may influence loneliness risk.

  **Methods:** Using data from a community sample at the U.S.-Mexico border, we examined social, economic, and health-related factors associated with loneliness among Mexican-origin adults.

  **Results:** We identified key social determinants of loneliness, revealing the protective role of family cohesion and social participation. Economic hardship and limited social networks were significantly associated with higher loneliness levels.

  **Conclusions:** Interventions targeting loneliness in this population should consider strengthening family connections and community participation opportunities.

## Plain Language Summary

This study looked at what makes Mexican-origin adults living near the Arizona-Mexico border feel lonely. We found that people with stronger family connections and those who participate in community activities felt less lonely. On the other hand, people facing money problems or who had fewer friends and family nearby felt more lonely.

**Why it matters:** Loneliness isn't just feeling sad—it's linked to serious health problems like heart disease and depression. Understanding what makes people lonely helps us design better programs to help them.
