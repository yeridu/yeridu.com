## About Me

I am a PhD Candidate at the University of Arizona's Mel & Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health, specializing in **Health Behavior and Health Promotion**. My research bridges **ethnographic methods with computational approaches** to understand and prevent gender-based violence, substance use, and mental health challenges among adolescents.

### The "Unicorn" Skillset

What makes my work distinctive is the ability to **quantify the qualitative**. I combine deep ethnographic fieldwork—from coastal villages in Oaxaca to police stations in Tijuana—with rigorous statistical analysis and emerging AI methods. This dual fluency allows me to capture the human complexity of public health challenges while generating actionable, population-level insights.

### Research Impact

My work spans **four countries** (Mexico, United States, Belize, South Africa) and has contributed to **12+ peer-reviewed publications** in journals including *The Lancet Public Health*, *BMJ Open*, and *American Journal of Public Health*. I have received **>$30,000 in research awards** including the prestigious Gustavo Cabrera Award for the best demography thesis in Mexico.

### Current Focus

I am completing my PhD with ongoing projects examining:
- **Systematic Review**: Examining effectiveness of RCT preventing both dating violence and substance use among adolescents
- **Green Dot Study**: Testing whether Green Dot reduced alcohol-related sexual assault victim-blaming attitudes (AR-SAVB), substance-related SV victimization and perpetration, and whether changes in AR-SAVB mediated SV outcomes.
- **YRBS Opioids Study**: Examining risk factors for non-medical prescription opioid use among U.S. youth
- **NVDRS Pregnancy Study**: Using NLP to analyze narratives of women who died during pregnancy/postpartum due to homicide, suicide or overdose after IPV exposure
- **Belize TCC Project**: Designing a life-skills intervention for adolescents in Southern Belize

*Expected graduation: May 2026*
